# TwitterDataService

What is it?
-----------

This is a project created as a mean to become more familiar with .NET and some concepts of Windows Comunication Foundation services.
It is an example of a simple service that provides api to obtain, save and present tweets from Twitter Public Stream.
TwitterDataService api consists of four methods of which one allows to request tweets from Twitter with filtering word 
and three other allow to retrieve data from database and get some overview of tweets.


How to try project?
-------------------

If you want to download a project and try it out you need a service host and a client that would communicate with service.
You can find them on my github account: ServiceHost and TwitterMonitor (client). In order to run the projects localy you need
to have installed Visual Studio (I worked on VS Express 2013 for Web). Some configuration changes may be also required depending
on you environment, so you should have some minimun familiarity with .NET.
